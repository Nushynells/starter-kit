The files with filenames starting with `hex` have hex dimensions (see [StickerConstructorSpec](https://github.com/terinjokes/StickerConstructorSpec)).

The standard hexagon sticker has a 2" diagonal and the dimensions shown below.

When printing them, the sticker printer will typically ask for a sticker with some bleed. However, there is no _custom_ bleed. Consult with the company you are using to print the stickers as to how big this bleed area should be.

There are two version of our hex sticker:

- A non-editable `.png` version _without_ a bleed area: 

- A `.psd` version which you can edit in Photoshop (if you do not have Photoshop but need edits, contact Bea). This one has a 3mm bleed which you can change: 

There is also a `.psd` version of the template for stickermule in case you want to use it with a different hex sticker:
