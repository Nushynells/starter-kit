# WiMLDS Starter Kit for New Chapters

## Overview of WiMLDS
WiMLDS is a community of women interested in machine learning and data science. We host events which include talks by prominent data scientists, lightning talks, technical workshops and networking events. Our members include engineers, technologists, statisticians, students and many other professionals who work in data science or would like to transition into this field. Our mission is to build a community of women in data science by means of connecting and educating our members with support from the Bay Area, NYC, Chicago, North Carolina and Boulder tech community. If youâ€™re interested in starting a new chapter please reach out to us.
